# PLTMLE

This repository contains sample R code to execute the pooled LTMLE algorithm, developped by Petersen *et al.* (2014). This code is similar to the one implemented in the *ltmleMSM* function in the *ltmle* R package version 1-1.0 developped by Schwab *et al.* (2013). However, this code is specific to the discretization problem presented in the manuscript "Impact of discretization of the timeline for longitudinal causal inference methods". The provided code is for a two time-point example and is presented as raw steps to illustrate the corresponding pooled LTMLE algorithm.

The function PLTMLE2TP_CV serves to compute the cross-validated variance of the pooled LTMLE estimate. Note that one can obtain the estimate by simply running the first part of the code, i.e. on the training data only.
